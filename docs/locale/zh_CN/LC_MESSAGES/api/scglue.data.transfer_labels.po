"First, nearest neighbors between reference and query cells are searched "
"and weighted by Jaccard index of SNN (shared nearest neighbors). The "
"Jaccard indices are then normalized per query cell to form a mapping "
"matrix. To obtain predictions for query cells, we multiply the above "
"mapping matrix to the one-hot matrix of reference labels. The category "
"with the highest score is taken as the final prediction, while its score "
"is interpreted as transfer confidence (stored as "
"\"{key_added}_confidence\" in ``query.obs``)."
